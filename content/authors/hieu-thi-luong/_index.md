I received my Ph.D. degree in Multidisciplinary Science in 2020 from SOKENDAI, Japan, and currently work as Project Researcher at National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo. My works focus on researching and developing novel solutions for Speech and Language Processing Systems. I'm interested in Speech Processing, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in general.

I also do programming and drawing as hobbies. More below.
