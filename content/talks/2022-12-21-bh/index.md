Pathological speech synthesis has traditionally been focused on improving the error rates of downstream pathological automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. However, this field has the potential to have a much broader impact beyond just pathological ASR. A speech synthesis system that could predict how a patient's voice would sound after tongue surgery or the onset of a disease, such as dysarthria, could be very useful for clinicians and patients. Such a system could be based on a surgical plan or metadata about the patient, and it could help clinicians make more informed decisions about the surgery. It could also help alleviate the stress of patients by giving them a better idea of what to expect after the surgery or onset of the disease. The talk will discuss the current progress and challenges in synthesising and evaluating pathological speech, both using voice conversion and articulatory synthesis methods.
