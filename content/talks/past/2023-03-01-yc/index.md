### Title
 Enable Fact Verification across Languages via Parallel Training with Regularizations

### Abstract
Fact verification is part of the fact checking task. In this study, we want to enable the fact verification task across language. We will introduce a new cross-lingual fact verification dataset XFEVER, which is constructed by extending the examples of the processed FEVER dataset to 6 languages, including isolated language such as Japanese. Moreover, we apply two translation method, auto-translation and human-translation, to observe that our models' performance on different resources.
For evaluation, we will provide baselines in 2 scenarios: zero-shot transfer learning and translate-train learning. For the second scenario, we will introduce different consistency regularizations.
