summary:
abstract: 'I will give self-introduction and have a briefly introduction of some related research on speech synthesis in our Tianjin University laboratory at first. Next, I will talk about my Ph.d topic which is expressive speech synthesis and will mainly introduce some of my previous research. Then, I will simply introduce the topic "Cross-speaker Style Transfer " and talk about my recently work and the big challenge "Few-shot" that is what I want to solve Next. Finally, I will discuss another topic I will be involved in at NII, speech synthesis in low resource languages. In my opinion, low resources could also be considered as a kind of Few-shot problem, which is also exactly related to my current PhD research.'
