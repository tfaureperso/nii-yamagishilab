summary:
abstract: ' In my talk, I will share my research on enabling Human-AI co-creativity in music making. I will start by discussing my previous work on MIDI-to-audio synthesis using Control-Synthesis. Then, I will delve into my work on few-shot neural instrument cloning with multi-instrument models. I will also present my recent work on TimbreCLIP, a text/audio embedding I trained on instrument notes. Additionally, I will showcase some of my work on generating symbolic music. Finally, I will give a brief overview of the work I will be pursuing at NII.'
