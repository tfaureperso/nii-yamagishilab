## Introduction
Formed in 2020, the VoicePrivacy initiative is spearheading the effort to develop privacy preservations solutions for speech technology. We aim to foster progress in the development of anonymisation and pseudonymisation solutions which suppress personally identifiable information contained within recordings of speech while preserving linguistic content and speech quality/naturalness. VoicePrivacy takes the form of a competitive benchmarking challenge, with common datasets, protocols and metrics. The first edition of VoicePrivacy was held in 2020, culminating in a special sessions held at INTERSPEECH 2020 and Odyssey 2020, and a special issue published in Elsevier Computer Speech and Language. VoicePrivacy 2022 is the second edition starts from March 2022.
