The VoiceMOS Challenge 2022 has ended! Material from the challenge will remain available online. Read our summary paper of the challenge [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11389).

## Introduction
Human listening tests are the gold standard for evaluating synthesized speech. Objective measures of speech quality have low correlation with human ratings, and the generalization abilities of current data-driven quality prediction systems suffer significantly from domain mismatch. The VoiceMOS Challenge aims to encourage research in the area of automatic prediction of Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) for synthesized speech.
