abstract: Progress in the development of spoofing countermeasures for automatic speaker
  recognition  is less advanced than equivalent work related to other biometric modalities.
  This chapter outlines the potential for even state-of-the-art automatic speaker
  recognition systems to be spoofed. While the use of a multitude of different datasets,
  protocols and metrics complicates the meaningful comparison of different vulnerabilities,
  we review previous work related to impersonation, replay, speech synthesis and voice
  conversion spoofing attacks. The article also presents an analysis of the early
  work to develop spoofing countermeasures. The literature shows that there is significant
  potential for automatic speaker verification systems to be spoofed, that significant
  further work is required to develop generalised countermeasures, that there is a
  need for standard datasets, evaluation protocols and metrics and that greater emphasis
  should be placed on text-dependent scenarios.
