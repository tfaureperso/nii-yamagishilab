abstract: Voice-based human-machine interfaces with an automatic speaker verification
  (ASV) component are commonly used in the market. However, the threat from presentation
  attacks is also growing since attackers can use recent speech synthesis technology
  to produce a natural-sounding voice of a victim. Presentation attack detection (PAD)
  for ASV, or speech anti-spoofing, is therefore indispensable. Research on voice
  PAD has seen significant progress since the early 2010s, including the advancement
  in PAD models, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns. This chapter presents
  a practical guide to the field of voice PAD, with a focus on logical access attacks
  using text-to-speech and voice conversion algorithms and spoofing countermeasures
  based on artifact detection. It introduces the basic concept of voice PAD, explains
  the common techniques, and provides an experimental study using recent methods on
  a benchmark dataset. Code for the experiments is open-sourced.
