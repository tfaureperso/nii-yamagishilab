abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to substantial improvements in
  deepfake generation, resulting in fake media with a more realistic appearance. Although
  deepfake media have potential application in a wide range of areas and are drawing
  much attention from both the academic and industrial communities, it also leads
  to serious social and criminal concerns. This chapter explores the evolution of
  and challenges in deepfake generation and detection. It also discusses possible
  ways to improve the robustness of deepfake detection for a wide variety of media
  (e.g., in-the-wild images and videos). Finally, it suggests a focus for future fake
  media research.
