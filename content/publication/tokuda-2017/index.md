abstract: This chapter introduces the idea of user-generated dialogueUDialogue technologycontent
  and describes our experimental exploration aimed at clarifying the mechanism and
  conditions that makes it workable in practice. One of the attractive points of a
  speech interface is to provide a vivid sense of interactivity that cannot be achieved
  with a text interface alone. This study proposes a framework that spoken dialogue
  systems are separated into content that can be produced and modified by users, and
  the systems that drive the content, and seek to clarify (1) the requirements of
  systems that enable the creation of attractive spoken dialogue, and (2) the conditions
  for the active generation of attractive dialogue content by users, while attempting
  to establish a method for realizing them. Experiments for validating user dialogue
  content generation were performed by installing interactive digital signage with
  a speech interface in public spaces as a dialogue device, and implementing a content
  generation environment for users via the Internet. The proposed framework is expected
  to lead to a breakthrough in the spread of using speech technology.
