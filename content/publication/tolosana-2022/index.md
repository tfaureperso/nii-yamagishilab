abstract: Recently, digital face manipulationDigital face manipulation and its detection
  have sparked large interest in industry and academia around the world. Numerous
  approaches have been proposed in the literature to create realistic face manipulationsFace
  manipulation, such as DeepFakesDeepFake and face morphs. To the human eye manipulated
  images and videos can be almost indistinguishable from real content. Although impressive
  progress has been reported in the automatic detection of such face manipulationsFace
  manipulation, this research field is often considered to be a cat and mouse game.
  This chapter briefly discusses the state of the art of digital face manipulationDigital
  face manipulation and detection. Issues and challenges that need to be tackled by
  the research community are summarized, along with future trends in the field.
