We consider a new spoofing scenario called “Partial Spoof” (PS) in which synthesized or transformed speech segments are embedded into a bona fide utterance. While existing countermeasures (CMs) can detect fully spoofed utterances, there is a need for their adaptation or extension to the PS scenario. We propose various improvements to construct a significantly more accurate CM that can detect and locate short-generated spoofed speech segments at finer temporal resolutions. First, we introduce newly developed self-supervised pre-trained models as enhanced feature extractors. Second, we extend our PartialSpoof database by adding segment labels for various temporal resolutions. Since the short spoofed speech segments to be embedded by attackers are of variable length, six different temporal resolutions are considered, ranging from as short as 20 ms to as large as 640 ms. Third, we propose a new CM that enables the simultaneous use of the segment-level labels at different temporal resolutions as well as utterance-level labels to execute utterance- and segment-level detection at the same time. We also show that the proposed CM is capable of detecting spoofing at the utterance level with low error rates in the PS scenario as well as in a related logical access (LA) scenario. The equal error rates of utterance-level detection on the PartialSpoof database and ASVspoof 2019 LA database were 0.77 and 0.90%, respectively.","tags":[],"title":"The PartialSpoof Database and Countermeasures for the Detection of Short Fake Speech Segments Embedded in an Utterance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cheng-I Jeff Lai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1671548400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671548400,"objectID":"2943768191200434eaf59f7621c9f8e9","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/talks/2022-12-20-jeff/","publishdate":"2022-12-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/2022-12-20-jeff/","section":"talks","summary":"Textless Phrase-Structure Induction from Visually-Grounded Speech","tags":[],"title":"Textless Phrase-Structure Induction from Visually-Grounded Speech","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Bence Halpern"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1671544800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671544800,"objectID":"dd1bbf3ed048f5c4bd5b8ac5c332e23d","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/talks/2022-12-21-bh/","publishdate":"2022-12-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/2022-12-21-bh/","section":"talks","summary":"Predicting and synthesising plausible speech examples after oral cancer treatment","tags":[],"title":"Predicting and synthesising plausible speech examples after oral cancer treatment","type":"talks"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"We are recruiting postdoctoral researchers in speech and audio processing! https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/about/recruit/2022/1007-2.html\nWe are also recruiting postdocs for topics in media processing, machine learning, multimedia security forensics, and social media! https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/about/recruit/2022/1028.html\n","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668868193,"objectID":"eb4bf091c1bada8869829db1293f05c5","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/news/2022-11-02-recruite/","publishdate":"2022-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2022-11-02-recruite/","section":"news","summary":"We are recruiting postdoctoral researchers in speech and audio processing! https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/about/recruit/2022/1007-2.html\nWe are also recruiting postdocs for topics in media processing, machine learning, multimedia security forensics, and social media! https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/about/recruit/2022/1028.html","tags":["Jobs"],"title":"We are recruiting postdocs!","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1642636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642636800,"objectID":"6e65efad46dcc57c25bb4fc48e37c335","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/challenges/vc/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/challenges/vc/","section":"challenges","summary":"Voice conversion (VC) refers to digital cloning of a person's voice; it can be used to modify audio waveform so that it appear as if spoken by someone else (target) than the original speaker (source).","tags":["Voice Conversion"],"title":"Voice Conversion (Singing Voice Conversion Challenge 2023 is Coming!)","type":"challenges"},{"authors":["Xin Wang","Junichi Yamagishi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672500190,"objectID":"1019765ae371faa5cd87c6d27a796618","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/wang-2022/","publishdate":"2022-12-31T15:23:10.536358Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Voice-based human-machine interfaces with an automatic speaker verification (ASV) component are commonly used in the market. However, the threat from presentation attacks is also growing since attackers can use recent speech synthesis technology to produce a natural-sounding voice of a victim. Presentation attack detection (PAD) for ASV, or speech anti-spoofing, is therefore indispensable. Research on voice PAD has seen significant progress since the early 2010s, including the advancement in PAD models, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns. This chapter presents a practical guide to the field of voice PAD, with a focus on logical access attacks using text-to-speech and voice conversion algorithms and spoofing countermeasures based on artifact detection. It introduces the basic concept of voice PAD, explains the common techniques, and provides an experimental study using recent methods on a benchmark dataset. Code for the experiments is open-sourced.","tags":[],"title":"A Practical Guide to Logical Access Voice Presentation Attack Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["XiaoXiao Miao","Xin Wang","Erica Cooper","Junichi Yamagishi","Natalia Tomashenko"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668948770,"objectID":"441dd99c91daae0bffe33b50525a36ec","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/miao-22-interspeech/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T12:52:49.893894Z","relpermalink":"/publication/miao-22-interspeech/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Analyzing Language-Independent Speaker Anonymization Framework under Unseen Conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"ASVspoof Latest Information Upcoming ASVspoof5 in 2023:\nDatabase creation: Autumn, 2022 Challenge set-up: First half, 2023 ASVspoof5 challenge: Second half, 2023 ","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"7e7bfa7d312eb281d40aebbd80ffe513","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/challenges/asvspoof/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/challenges/asvspoof/","section":"challenges","summary":"The ASVspoof initiative was conceived to foster progress in the development of countermeasures (CM) to protect automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems from spoofing attacks.","tags":["ASVspoof"],"title":"ASVspoof","type":"challenges"},{"authors":["Chang Zeng","Xin Wang","Erica Cooper","XiaoXiao Miao","Junichi Yamagishi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668948774,"objectID":"354f8d9da69032dc3264cef62616b868","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/9746688/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T12:52:54.592096Z","relpermalink":"/publication/9746688/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Attention Back-End for Automatic Speaker Verification with Multiple Enrollment Utterances","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hemlata Tak","Massimiliano Todisco","Xin Wang","Jee-weon Jung","Junichi Yamagishi","Nicholas Evans"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668948771,"objectID":"3b3d786421e94ea0595069360d168c07","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/tak-22-odyssey/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T12:52:51.691202Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tak-22-odyssey/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Deepfake Detection Using Wav2vec 2.0 and Data Augmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Latest Information The 12th ISCA Speech Synthesis Workshop will be held in Grenoble, France, 26-28 August 2023.

One downside of this success is the advent of attacks using deepfakesDeepFake, a family of tools that enable anyone to use a personal computer to easily create fake videos of someone from a short video found online. Several detectors have been introduced to deal with such attacks. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, CNN-basedConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) detectors have usually been upgraded by increasing their depth and/or their width, adding more internal connections, or fusing several features or predicted probabilities from multiple CNNsConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN). As a result, CNN-basedConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) detectors have become bigger, consume more memory and computation power, and require more training data. Moreover, there is concern about their generalizability to deal with unseen manipulation methods. In this chapter, we argue that our forensic-oriented capsule networkCapsule network overcomes these limitations and is more suitable than conventional CNNsConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect deepfakesDeepFake. The superiority of our ``Capsule-Forensics'' Capsule-Forensics network is due to the use of a pretrained feature extractor, statistical pooling layers, and a dynamic routing algorithm. This design enables the Capsule-ForensicsCapsule-Forensics network to outperform a CNNConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a similar design and to be from 5 to 11 times smaller than a CNNConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with similar performance.","tags":[],"title":"Capsule-Forensics Networks for Deepfake Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haoyu Li","Junichi Yamagishi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668948770,"objectID":"beae4779c04117d592cc57210bf33346","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/li-22-e-interspeech/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T12:52:50.606786Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-22-e-interspeech/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"DDS: A new device-degraded speech dataset for speech enhancement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Wang","Junichi Yamagishi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668948773,"objectID":"177ea1612e654c6e17d1bb83112b7f85","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/9746204/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T12:52:53.505524Z","relpermalink":"/publication/9746204/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Estimating the Confidence of Speech Spoofing Countermeasure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruben Tolosana","Christian Rathgeb","Ruben Vera-Rodriguez","Christoph Busch","Luisa Verdoliva","Siwei Lyu","Huy Hong Nguyen","Junichi Yamagishi","Isao Echizen","Peter Rot","Klemen Grm","Vitomir Štruc","Antitza Dantcheva","Zahid Akhtar","Sergio Romero-Tapiador","Julian Fierrez","Aythami Morales","Javier Ortega-Garcia","Els Kindt","Catherine Jasserand","Tarmo Kalvet","Marek Tiits"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672500189,"objectID":"9accc0671198e192fb521cc6d51d506a","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/tolosana-2022/","publishdate":"2022-12-31T15:23:08.92279Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tolosana-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Recently, digital face manipulationDigital face manipulation and its detection have sparked large interest in industry and academia around the world.

Although deepfake media have potential application in a wide range of areas and are drawing much attention from both the academic and industrial communities, it also leads to serious social and criminal concerns. This chapter explores the evolution of and challenges in deepfake generation and detection. It also discusses possible ways to improve the robustness of deepfake detection for a wide variety of media (e.g., in-the-wild images and videos). Finally, it suggests a focus for future fake media research.","tags":[],"title":"Robust Deepfake on Unrestricted Media: Generation and Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Wang","Junichi Yamagishi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668948767,"objectID":"516a858002d9b06c8efa3e0e3abdba88","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/wang-2022-spoofed/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T12:52:47.375417Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2022-spoofed/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Spoofed training data for speech spoofing countermeasure can be efficiently created using neural vocoders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chang Zeng","Lin Zhang","Meng Liu","Junichi Yamagishi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668948771,"objectID":"c2abb11e75f31b801a12e45f71af679c","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/zeng-22-interspeech/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T12:52:50.974254Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zeng-22-interspeech/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Spoofing-Aware Attention based ASV Back-end with Multiple Enrollment Utterances and a Sampling Strategy for the SASV Challenge 2022","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cheng-Hung Hu","Yu-Huai Peng","Junichi Yamagishi","Yu Tsao","Hsin-Min Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668948773,"objectID":"c4975ab4c747daf1794a45355e2e3896","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/9716822/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T12:52:53.140244Z","relpermalink":"/publication/9716822/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"SVSNet: An End-to-End Speaker Voice Similarity Assessment Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lin Zhang","Xin Wang","Erica Cooper","Nicholas Evans","Junichi Yamagishi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668948768,"objectID":"b2ea465bf926fe52172d6ad9afcc5ed2","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/zhang-2022-partialspoof/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T12:52:48.098004Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2022-partialspoof/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The PartialSpoof Database and Countermeasures for the Detection of Short Generated Audio Segments Embedded in a Speech Utterance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wen Chin Huang","Erica Cooper","Yu Tsao","Hsin-Min Wang","Tomoki Toda","Junichi Yamagishi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668948770,"objectID":"1d23b0baaea39fe2d4caae480e4759a7","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/huang-22-f-interspeech/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T12:52:50.247958Z","relpermalink":"/publication/huang-22-f-interspeech/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The VoiceMOS Challenge 2022","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natalia Tomashenko","Xin Wang","Emmanuel Vincent","Jose Patino","Brij Mohan Lal Srivastava","Paul-Gauthier Noé","Andreas Nautsch","Nicholas Evans","Junichi Yamagishi","Benjamin O’Brien"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668948772,"objectID":"ae0ffaa99ed85114c9150e8a4eeb8f73","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/tomashenko-2022-voiceprivacy/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T12:52:52.781113Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tomashenko-2022-voiceprivacy/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The VoicePrivacy 2020 Challenge: Results and findings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuan Shi","Erica Cooper","Junichi Yamagishi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668948775,"objectID":"3a1ed5bb960fad110b669c462f144b2d","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/9670718/","publishdate":"2022-11-20T12:52:54.954009Z","relpermalink":"/publication/9670718/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Use of Speaker Recognition Approaches for Learning and Evaluating Embedding Representations of Musical Instrument Sounds","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"VoiceMOS The VoiceMOS Challenge 2022 has ended!

the past few years, significant progress has been made in the field of presentation attack detection (PAD) for automatic speaker recognition (ASV). This includes the development of new speech corpora, standard evaluation protocols and advancements in front-end feature extraction and back-end classifiers. The use of standard databases and evaluation protocols has enabled for the first time the meaningful benchmarking of different PAD solutions. This chapter summarises the progress, with a focus on studies completed in the last 3 years. The article presents a summary of findings and lessons learned from two ASVspoof challenges, the first community-led benchmarking efforts. These show that ASV PAD remains an unsolved problem and that further attention is required to develop generalised PAD solutions which have potential to detect diverse and previously unseen spoofing attacks.","tags":[],"title":"Introduction to Voice Presentation Attack Detection and Recent Advances","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Keiichi Tokuda","Akinobu Lee","Yoshihiko Nankaku","Keiichiro Oura","Kei Hashimoto","Daisuke Yamamoto","Ichi Takumi","Takahiro Uchiya","Shuhei Tsutsumi","Steve Renals","Junichi Yamagishi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672500189,"objectID":"584cd824e85c8cb7063457c6311cc665","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/tokuda-2017/","publishdate":"2022-12-31T15:23:09.739813Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tokuda-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"This chapter introduces the idea of user-generated dialogueUDialogue technologycontent and describes our experimental exploration aimed at clarifying the mechanism and conditions that makes it workable in practice. One of the attractive points of a speech interface is to provide a vivid sense of interactivity that cannot be achieved with a text interface alone. This study proposes a framework that spoken dialogue systems are separated into content that can be produced and modified by users, and the systems that drive the content, and seek to clarify (1) the requirements of systems that enable the creation of attractive spoken dialogue, and (2) the conditions for the active generation of attractive dialogue content by users, while attempting to establish a method for realizing them. Experiments for validating user dialogue content generation were performed by installing interactive digital signage with a speech interface in public spaces as a dialogue device, and implementing a content generation environment for users via the Internet. The proposed framework is expected to lead to a breakthrough in the spread of using speech technology.","tags":[],"title":"User Generated Dialogue Systems: uDialogue","type":"publication"},{"authors":["順一 山岸","恵一 徳田","智基 戸田","よしこ みわ"," 国立情報学研究所"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672500191,"objectID":"46349549d602faf21de004b4a4c23473","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/bb-18335564/","publishdate":"2022-12-31T15:23:10.931204Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bb-18335564/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"おしゃべりなコンピュータ : 音声合成技術の現在と未来","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas Evans","Tomi Kinnunen","Junichi Yamagishi","Zhizheng Wu","Federico Alegre","Phillip De Leon"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672500188,"objectID":"348bf12ed2a4343389d66f73db4d0ca6","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/evans-2014/","publishdate":"2022-12-31T15:23:08.104441Z","relpermalink":"/publication/evans-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Progress in the development of spoofing countermeasures for automatic speaker recognition  is less advanced than equivalent work related to other biometric modalities. This chapter outlines the potential for even state-of-the-art automatic speaker recognition systems to be spoofed. While the use of a multitude of different datasets, protocols and metrics complicates the meaningful comparison of different vulnerabilities, we review previous work related to impersonation, replay, speech synthesis and voice conversion spoofing attacks. The article also presents an analysis of the early work to develop spoofing countermeasures. The literature shows that there is significant potential for automatic speaker verification systems to be spoofed, that significant further work is required to develop generalised countermeasures, that there is a need for standard datasets, evaluation protocols and metrics and that greater emphasis should be placed on text-dependent scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"Speaker Recognition Anti-spoofing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarah Creer","Phil Green","Stuart Cunningham","Junichi Yamagishi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1262304e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672500191,"objectID":"956efee20036a8404fd222573334f29c","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/publication/creer-2010-building/","publishdate":"2022-12-31T15:23:11.325808Z","relpermalink":"/publication/creer-2010-building/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Building personalized synthetic voices for individuals with dysarthria using the HTS toolkit","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"62fea3e05460f95efe6cc5b6342d9794","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/databases/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/databases/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"32a76a54894d6ac47709b46a0108f658","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/grants/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/grants/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8d41a9ddd0e7e49753dab2e66e906918","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/recruitments/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/recruitments/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://zlin0.github.io/nii-yamagishilab/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"widget_page"}]
